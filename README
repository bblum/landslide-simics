This is the repository for Ben Blum <bblum@andrew.cmu.edu>'s master's project at
CMU, under the supervision of Garth Gibson. The goal is to produce a "more
intelligent than pure randomness" race condition detector for kernels, currently
being implemented as a Simics module to run on 15-410 "Pebbles" kernels.

To build:  cd work/; make
To run:    cd pebsim/; ./simics4

There are probably important intricacies of the project that I've neglected to
say, but I'm just a README file, so what do I know?
