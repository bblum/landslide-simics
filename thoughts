performance
	language
		calling into python will suck - use C
		how fast would hasqel be? how easy?
	simics uses JIT for speed - how many orders of magnitude slowdown?

things to do
	learn simics C hooqs
	checkpoint 0: something that fires/prints on every guest instruction

stack
	./simics-model-builder-4.0.16/src/extensions/sample-memhier/sample-memhier.c
	snoop_memory interface probably the way to go
		note how to turn the STC off
	trace.c - trace_instr_operate

	to do next: debug trace and make sure the conf_object_t cast to a hax_t has the right hax_magic

to hook in hax:
	new-tracer
	@hax = SIM_create_object("hax", "hax0", [])
	# ...
	trace0.start
	@SIM_set_attribute(SIM_get_object("trace0"), "consumer", hax)
	# note: setting trace0.start resets the bt->trace_consume to text_tracer; set_consumer after that.
