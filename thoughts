performance
	language
		calling into python will suck - use C
		how fast would hasqel be? how easy?
	simics uses JIT for speed - how many orders of magnitude slowdown?

things to do
	learn simics C hooqs
	checkpoint 0: something that fires/prints on every guest instruction

stack
	./simics-model-builder-4.0.16/src/extensions/sample-memhier/sample-memhier.c
	snoop_memory interface probably the way to go
		note how to turn the STC off
