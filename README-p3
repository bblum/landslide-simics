This is the repository for Ben Blum <bblum@andrew.cmu.edu>'s master's project at
CMU, under the supervision of Garth Gibson. The goal is to produce a "more
intelligent than pure randomness" race condition detector for kernels, currently
being implemented as a Simics module to run on 15-410 "Pebbles" kernels.

To use landslide with your kernel:

0) Run "./prepare-workspace.sh".
1) Annotate your kernel with tell_landslide*(), using tell_landslide.{c,h}
2) In pebsim/, fill out config.landslide
3) In work/modules/landslide/, implement the functions in student.c
5) In pebsim/, run "./landslide".

More info, and actual insight into each of these processes, is to be found in
the user guide: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/landslide-guide.pdf
