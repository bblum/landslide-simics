 * Abstract:
 *	strcmp (s1, s2) compares the strings "s1" and "s2".
 *	It returns 0 if the strings are identical. It returns
 *	> 0 if the first character that differs into two strings
 *	is larger in s1 than in s2 or if s1 is longer than s2 and 
 *	the contents  are identical up to the length of s2.
 *	It returns < 0 if the first differing character is smaller 
 *	in s1 than in s2 or if s1 is shorter than s2 and the
 *	contents are identical upto the length of s1.
