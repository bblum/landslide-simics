Landslide for P2s

Testing P2s with Landslide is significantly easier than testing P3s.

Steps:

1. run "./p2-setup.sh ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_P2_PROJECT_DIRECTORY"
2. run "./landslide -h" to learn command line options
3. run ./landslide with various config options, or none to use defaults
4. repeat step 3 until satisfied
